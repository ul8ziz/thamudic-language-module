# Thamudic Text Recognition Project

## Project Overview
An advanced optical character recognition (OCR) system for ancient Thamudic inscriptions, leveraging state-of-the-art image processing and machine learning techniques.

## Project Objectives
- Collect and organize Thamudic text images
- Develop robust image preprocessing pipelines
- Create a specialized machine learning model for Thamudic character recognition
- Contribute to archaeological research and linguistic preservation
